# Contributing to the Brand Identity Generator

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is a collaborative effort, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under **Issues**.
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **open a new one**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement suggestion.
-   Clearly describe the proposed enhancement, why it's needed, and provide examples of how it would work. This allows for a discussion before you put significant effort into implementation.

1.  **Fork the repository** by clicking the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
